# Result Scraper
## üóÇÔ∏è Description

The Result Scraper is a web scraping tool designed to extract CGPA data from a specific website. It provides a user-friendly interface to input admission year, degree, branch, start and end roll numbers, and the number of parallel threads. The tool then scrapes the CGPA data, generates a CSV file, and displays summary statistics, a histogram of CGPA distribution, and a table of top performers. This project is ideal for users who need to analyze CGPA data for a large number of students.

The Result Scraper uses a combination of technologies such as Streamlit, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Selenium to achieve its functionality. The tool is designed to be easy to use and provides a simple way to visualize and analyze CGPA data.
